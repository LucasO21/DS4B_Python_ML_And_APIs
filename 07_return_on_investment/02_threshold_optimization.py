# 1.0 MAKE THE LEAD STRATEGY FROM THE SCORED SUBSCRIBERS:
#   lead_make_strategy()


# Workflow



# 2.0 AGGREGATE THE LEAD STRATEGY RESULTS
#  lead_aggregate_strategy_results()


# Workflow


    
# 3.0 CALCULATE EXPECTED VALUE (FOR ONE SET OF INPUTS) ----
#  lead_strategy_calc_expected_value()



# Workflow:



# 4.0 OPTIMIZE THE THRESHOLD AND GENERATE A TABLE
#  lead_strategy_create_thresh_table()



# Workflow:



# 5.0 SELECT THE BEST THRESHOLD
#  def lead_select_optimum_thresh()



# Workflow



# 6.0 GET EXPECTED VALUE RESULTS ----
#  def lead_get_expected_value()




# 7.0 PLOT THE OPTIMAL THRESHOLD ----
#  def lead_plot_optim_thresh()



# Workflow



# 8.0 MAKE THE OPTIMAL STRATEGY ----



# FINAL OPTIMIZATION RESULTS ----
# - Use one function to perform the automation and collect the results
#   def lead_score_strategy_optimization()



# Workflow



# CONCLUSIONS ----

# Business Leaders may freak out if they see a big hit in sales
#  even though it could be beneficial in long term
# Recommend to start with a smaller strategy of focusing on 
#  top 95% 
# We can set this up with the Threshold Override
